The circuit is designed on top of Arduino Micro, but changing the I/O level and clock to 3.3v and 8MHz respectively. The MCU has been loaded the same bootloader and fuses with [Sparkfun Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12587). To upload program, [install Sparkfun Arduino Boards](https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards#installation-instructions) to your Arduino IDE, and choose "Sparkfun Pro Micro" as board, and "Atmega32U4 (3.3v, 8 MHz)" as processor. The onboard bluetooth module HC-06 works only with Android and Windows, not iOS.
