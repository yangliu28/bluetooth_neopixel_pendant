The circuit design is based on Arduino Micro, but changed the power and clock to 3.3v and 8MHz. The most convenient way to configure the device is with the sparkfun arduino pro micro bootloader, which has a 3.3v/8MHz version. So install the Sparkfun Arduino boards to upload your program to the device.
