The circuit is designed on top of Arduino Micro, but changing the I/O level and clock to 3.3v and 8MHz respectively. The hardware controller has been loaded the same settings (bootloader and fuses) with [Sparkfun Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12587). To upload program, follow the [installation instructions] to install Sparkfun Arduino Boards to your Arduino IDE, and choose "Sparkfun Pro Micro" as board, and "Atmega32U4 (3.3v, 8 MHz)" as processor.

The onboard bluetooth module HC-06 works only with Android and Windows, but not on iOS. IPhone only supports a few Bluetooth profiles and BLE, not hardware-developer-friendly at all.
